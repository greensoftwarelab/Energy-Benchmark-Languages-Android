# Warnings/Errors 

The following programs use multiple libraries in multiple programming languages that we can't install correctly under termux environment, so we can't consider them: `pidigits`, `regexredux` and `k-nucleotide`.

Currently, it's not possible to run `reverse-complement` in swift, once it uses `FILE` type, which is not available in termux environment.
