# Warnings/Errors

Currently, there isn't any program working in Lisp/Fortran, so we can't consider them. It may be problems with the compilers.

The following programs use multiple libraries in multiple programming languages that we can't install correctly under termux environment, so we can't consider them: `pidigits`, `regexredux` and `k-nucleotide`.
